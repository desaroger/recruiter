# Introduction

Recruiter is a web app for recruiters who want manage his contacts network. This project only has learning purposes and to check my skills.

#Requirements

You need to build an Angular app with:

- A list of contacts (WhatsApp like)
- A detail/edit view of each contact
- It should allow create, edit and delete entries
- You can create a dummy-server

# First approach

I am going to make an MVP with the minimum requirements: A basic CRUD app of contacts. Name, phone, etc.
And later I will add extra functionality, like search, groups, etc.

I'm going to use Angular 1.6. I will use Webpack to compile everything, pug and sass. ES6 too with babel.
I will try to add some basic tests. I am not happy unless everything is tested, but on this frontend application, as testing directives in Angular is such a nightmare, I will be happy if I can test some basic functionality.
